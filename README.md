# kwant_graphene
kwant simulation

This program is intended for quantum simulation in grapehne system, base on Kwant, which is a free (open source), powerful, and easy to use Python package for numerical calculations on tight-binding models with a strong focus on quantum transport.

## Program structure
1. Initialize the parameter space
2. define onsite and hopping terms.
3. Make a system
   -define system shape
   -add sites
   -add leads
   -attach leads
   -finalize system
 4. Plot the system, test the program within a smaller parameter space
 5. Plot conductance as a function of magnetic field and Fermi level
